            <p class="sectionTag text-small">"I am not afraid of death. But I don't want to die prematurely" says Stephen Hawking. He can't speak, he can't walk, he can't do anything, he still wants to live. Stephen says, "Death is certain. But whatever you want to do between your birth and death is your wish. No matter how hard your life is. You can do anything and become successful". Stephen was born on 8 January 1942, in Oxford, England. When Stephen was born he lived in London Highgate, where the bombing was usual. So for the sake of Stephen, they went to Oxford. From childhood only, he was very clever. His father was a doctor and his mother was a housewife. Stephen's intelligence's introduction is that his friends would call him Einstein. He liked Mathematics so much. Even, he broke the electronic machines and turned them into computers. At the age of 17, he joined Oxford University. In Oxford, while studying, he had some trouble in his daily work. Once during holidays, he went to his home. While he was coming downstairs he suddenly fainted and he fell. At first, everybody thought that he was weak. But repeatedly, these incidents were repeated. After a checkup, their parents got to know he got a never-curing disease called Neuron Motor disease. In this disease, the muscles would stop working. The doctor told, he can't live more than 2 years. Stephen was also shocked by this.</p>

            <p class="sectionTag text-small">But he told, "I can't die that easily. Because I have a lot to do". Stephen ignored his disease and started his scientific life. He dedicated his life to science. Slowly, he started gaining popularity. He thought that the disease was a boon to him. But on the other hand, his body was not supporting him. Slowly, his right side of the body stopped working. When the disease increased, he needed a wheelchair. His chair is made with a computer. His computer was made of advanced technology. The technology would detect his head, eyes, and finger's vibrations to understand what he is trying to say. Slowly, his whole body stopped working. But the plus point was he was physically weak, not mentally weak. After that, people were only watching him and he was defeating death. He made the Black Hole concept and Hawking radiation in front of the world. To publish it easily, he wrote a book called A Brief History of Time, which created a big surprise among scientists. He officially went to space even after being paralyzed. On his own power, he became the most unique scientist of all time.</p>
